Do you prefer to keep NFC off and only enable it when needed? Ever wondered why NFC isn't part of Android's Quick Settings by default? Honestly, same here! Well, look no further‚Äîthis is the shortcut you've been waiting for! üéâ

This simple Android app adds an **NFC Shortcut tile** to the Quick Settings Panel, combining security and convenience by providing a direct link to the NFC settings page, all while adhering to Android's secure architecture.

## üîí Security Considerations

This app adheres to Android's security guidelines. Direct NFC toggling from the Quick Settings tile is **not allowed** due to security restrictions designed to protect user control and system stability. Instead, the app provides a secure and efficient way to access the NFC settings page quickly.

## ‚ùì Can you put this in the Google Play Store please?

Unfortunately no. I am not planning to create a Play Developer account. It costs money and it also exposes my email, partial/full address. Sorry! You can look for threads online similar to this one: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/thread/290790624/full-legal-address-gets-shown-for-private-developer-account?hl=en
