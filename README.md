# Android NFC Shortcut

A very simple Android app that adds an **NFC tile** to the Quick Settings Panel, allowing you to toggle NFC settings much quicker.

This app prioritizes user security and simplicity by leveraging Android's secure architecture. Instead of toggling NFC directly (which is restricted by Android's security model), the app provides a quick shortcut to the NFC settings page, where you can manage NFC as needed.

## üîí Security Considerations
